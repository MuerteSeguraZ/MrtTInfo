# WHAT'S NEW [23/12/2025]
  - Added PEB extraction (PEB, Debugged, ImagePath, CommandLine)
  - Added an output file to show correctness. Since most of TEB & PEB extraction are current-process, it will **only** show the output of our process, ***MrtTInfoTest.exe***. If in the future, I (or others) add other-process reading, it will show other process's output as well.
